# Student-Report-Card
My goal is to practice MERN stack.
## How I Worked on this app -

### Express server setup with initial routes
* Installed - express express-validator mongoose, development server - nodemon
* Made server.js as the entry point of backend by modifying main and scripts in package.json
* Initialized express in server.js and defined routes for student and report card API.
* Defined database credential details and db connection in config folder.

### Mongoose Model
* Created student and report card model with Schema

### API Request Validation 
* Done by check and validationResult methods from 'express-validator.

### API Testing - POSTMAN
